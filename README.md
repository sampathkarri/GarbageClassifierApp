# 🧠 Garbage Classifier using EfficientNetV2B2

This is a machine learning app that classifies waste images into:
- 📦 Cardboard
- 🥃 Glass
- 🔩 Metal
- 📄 Paper
- 🥤 Plastic
- 🗑️ Trash

Upload or capture an image using your webcam. The model will analyze and tell you what type of garbage it is, along with prediction confidence.
